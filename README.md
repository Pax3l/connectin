This is a project for a summer course, created by Eleni and Kristel. The website has a simple login system, where users can insert data into the database, and the information stored in the database can be displayed on the website.

Uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Handlebars.

To get started, be sure you have Node and MongoDB installed.

1. Type `npm install` when inside your root project directory. This will install all necessary node modules. 
2. Create a data folder inside the project folder either manually, or in the command line with `mkdir data`.
3. Create a new command line window and type `mongod -dbpath drag_data_folder_here`. This will connect MongoDB with your server's data folder.
4. Start server with `node express.js`. Site will be running on localhost port 3000.
